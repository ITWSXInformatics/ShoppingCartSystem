## Project Description

Our project creates a full-stack product, which includes frontend pages, backend functions and database connections. Our functional requirements are:
1. Shopping cart system save data on SQLlite Database
2. Frontend: Javascript, Backend: Python with Django Framework
3. Payment agent to check customersâ€™ financial information

Our project also has three main non-functional requirements. Firstly, the system will interact with users as a web application. In other words, our product will give customers an interactive experience. Second, our goal is to give our customers a convenient and quick shopping experience. Unlike Amazon, our frontend website deletes many useless information and lets our users keep focus on the important contents like delivery address. Last but not least, our product allows customers to successfully place orders to purchase the goods they want.
